    "For this assignment we want to use some sort of tree based model to classify the data below. We have a very small training set, so overfitting is a very real concern. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some specifics for this assignment:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Please use the show_eda to control if EDA stuff is shown. I don't really need to see all the EDA stuff (nor do you after you've done it), so we can make it configurable with a variable to speed up time. Please set this FALSE when you submit, so I can run all and see the outcome without histograms etc...\n",
    "<li>Please ensure that whatever model you end up with is in a variable named best at the end.\n",
    "<li>Please use some pipeline in prepping the data. The test data is in an identical format to the training data, so whatever pipeline you've created for your training will work for the testing. \n",
    "<li>The accuracy scoring will be an average of accuracy and roc_auc. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading Metrics\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><b>Pipeline Used - 10pts</b> The data loading needs to be in a pipeline. See the test part for illustration. When testing I'll call your pipe with the new data (format is identical to training), so any prep stuff should be in the pipeline. \n",
    "<li><b>Tree Based Model Used - 5pts</b> The model used for classification needs to be some variety of tree, beyond that it is up to you. \n",
    "<li><b>Accuracy - 5pts</b> The final accuracy acheived. This will be a rough ranking, I'm assuming most people will get a similar level of accuracy, marks will only be deducted if yours is far wosrse, as that's an indication that you probably didn't take any/many steps to improve things. \n",
    "<li><b>Clarity and Formatting - 5pts</b> Is it organized and can I read it?\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> <b>Note:</b> for this assignment, and in general, please get rid of my comments and replace them with your own. I'm going to read this, so all of these instructions aren't really required. Think of this as a template, get rid of the stuff that isn't needed, and leave only the things you need to explain your code. \n",
